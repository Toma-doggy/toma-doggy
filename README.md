# Toma-Doggy
  ## Description 
  This application delivers the user the experience of taking care of a virtual pet. The design is purposefully simplistic and pixelated, conjuring memories of our application's namesake, the Tamagotchi. This user is able to create an account on our application, select a pet, and interact with their pet in order to keep it happy!
